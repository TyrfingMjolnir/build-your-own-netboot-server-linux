modify the NBImageInfo.plist

package the booter rpm using your rpm package method of choice

booter image on the netboot server

build the appliance using boxgrinder

move it to your hypervisor (supports vmware, hyper-v and kvm)

add your subnet that will be served at the end of the dhcpd.conf file:

subnet 192.168.56.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {}
